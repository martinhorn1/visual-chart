## Project Name

Visual Chart

## How it works

A person must answer to all the questions. The questions are categorized and used to calculate the average value of the categories (T1, T2, ... in front of the questions are the category numbers).
After answering the questions and sending them, the average results are shown on a chart. Clicking on different chart sectors leads to different webpages (right now the webpages are random).

## Project Status

This project needs some improvements, like showing an alert when some questions are not answered.

## Reflection

This project was made during an internship in the Institute of Education in University of Tartu. For deployment purposes it was supposed to be built using plain HTML, CSS and JS.
By answering the questions a person could evaluate their school's innovativeness and by clicking on different sectors a person could find services offered by University of Tartu to improve the school's innovativeness.
